## General information
- This is a simple clone of "**Frogger**" game originally made by [Konami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami) in 1981. It was written in pure JavaScript with a little help of HTML5 and CSS code. It uses HTML canvas for drawing graphics and JS code for mechanics.
- The project presents my programming skills how I do write code taking care of several optimisations.
- The player controls the frog which must reach the top of the screen crossing the road and the river.
- Win condition: the player reached the top of the screen.
- Lose condition: the player lost all lives.
