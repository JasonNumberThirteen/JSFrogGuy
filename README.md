## General information
- This is a simple clone of "**Frogger**" game originally made by [Sega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega) in 1981. It was written in pure JavaScript with a little help of HTML5 and CSS code. It uses HTML canvas for drawing graphics and JS code for mechanics.
- The project presents my programming skills how I do write code taking care of several optimisations.
- The player controls the frog which must reach the top of the screen crossing the road and the river.
- Win condition: the player reached the top of the screen.
- Lose condition: the player lost all lives.

## Used technologies
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined") IDE for writing code,
- HTML5 for displaying the game window using canvas,
- CSS for adjusting the game window,
- JS for game mechanics.
